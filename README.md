# 👩‍💻📖 Online-Book-Store
This project involves downloading multiple CSV files and performing SQL queries to analyze, filter, and derive insights from the data. It demonstrates basic data handling, querying, and analysis using SQL.

✨ In this project, I worked with three interconnected CSV files using PostgreSQL:
Orders, Books, and Customers.

The Books dataset contains a unique Book ID

The Customers dataset contains a unique Customer ID

The Orders dataset links both Book ID and Customer ID, establishing relationships between the tables

🔍 Using PostgreSQL, I performed basic and advanced SQL queries to:

Analyze customer purchasing behavior

Explore order and book relationships

Practice JOINs, filtering, aggregation, and subqueries

Work with relational data in a real-world scenario

🛠️ Skills Practiced:
PostgreSQL • SQL • Data Analysis • Joins • Relational Databases • CSV Data Handling

📚 This project strengthened my understanding of relational database concepts and practical SQL querying.
